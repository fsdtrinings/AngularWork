Project 1 - Microservice for OTP generation and validation  - Sumit Adlekha
Problem statement: Develop a service to provide an API to generate an OTP and each OTP should be valid for a specified time period, e.g. 5 minutes. 
Another API should be provided to validate the OTP against that OTP entered by the user.
User should not be able to enter the OTP for any other user.

Tech stack - Use Java/ Spring Boot and SQL engine to develop this.

Write Unit Tests

Write performance test cases – using tools like JMeter/ Gatling. 

Good to have – if integration can be done with sending the OTP over email or Phone SMS.
